    <h1>MODULE: 4 (JavaScript Basic & DOM)</h1>
   <div class="container">
     <ol>
        <li>What is JavaScript?</li>
        <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) </p>
   
        <li>What is the use of isNaN function? </li>
        <p>isNaN() is a function property of the global object. For number values, isNaN() tests if the number is the value NaN . When the argument to the isNaN() function is not of type Number, the value is first coerced to a number, and the resulting value is then compared against NaN .</p>

        <li>What is negative Infinity? </li>
        <p>NEGATIVE_INFINITY is a special numeric value that is returned when an arithmetic operation or mathematical function generates a negative value greater than the largest representable number in JavaScript (i.e., more negative than -Number. MAX_VALUE) . JavaScript displays the NEGATIVE_INFINITY value as -Infinity .</p>

        <li>Which company developed JavaScript?</li>
        <p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.</p>

        <li>What are undeclared and undefined variables?</li>
       <p> <ul>
            <li>Undefined: It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. Undefined is not a keyword.</li> 

            <li>Undeclared: It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier using the var or const keyword. If we use ‘typeof’ operator to get the value of an undeclared variable, we will face the runtime error with the return value as “undefined”. The scope of the undeclared variables is always global.</li>
        </ul></p>
         
        <li> What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState? </li>

        <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>ViewState</th>
                    <th>SessionState</th>

            <tr>
                <td>Maintained at page level only.</td>
                <td>Maintained at session level.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>View state can only be visible from a single page and not multiple pages.	</td>
                <td>Session state value availability is across all pages available in a user session.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>It will retain values in the event of a postback operation occurring.</td>
                <td>In session state, user data remains in the server. Data is available to user until the browser is closed or there is session expiration.</td>

                <td>ViewState values are lost/cleared when new page is loaded.	</td>
                <td>SessionState can be cleared by programmer or user or in case of timeouts. </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
         </table>
        </p>

         <li>What is === operator?</li>
         <p>The strict equality ( === ) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different</p>
    
         <li>How can the style/class of an element be changed?</li>
         <p>To change all classes for an element:
            To replace all existing classes with one or more new classes, set the className attribute: document.getElementById("MyElement").className = "MyClass"; (You can use a space-delimited list to apply multiple classes.)</p>
        
        <li>How to read and write a file using JavaScript?</li>
        <p><ol>
            <li>file=fopen(getScriptPath(),0); The function fread() is used for reading the file content.</li>
            <li>  str = fread(file,flength(file)) ; The function fwrite() is used to write the contents to the file.</li>
            <li>file = fopen("c:\MyFile.txt", 3);// opens the file for writing.</li>    
        </ol></p>

        <li> What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</li>
       <p><ul>
            JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

               <li>for - loops through a block of code a number of times </li>
               <li> for/in - loops through the properties of an object</li>
               <li> for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object</li>
               <li> while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
                <li>do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
        </ul></p> 

        <li> How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript? </li>
        <p>To convert a string to an integer parseInt(), Number(), and Unary operator(+) function is used in javascript. parseInt() function returns Nan( not a number) when the string doesn't contain number. If a string with a number is sent, then only that number will be returned as the output.</p>

        <li>What is the function of the delete operator?</li>
        <p>The delete operator removes a property from an object. If the property's value is an object and there are no more references to the object, the object held by that property is eventually released automatically.</p>
        
        <li>What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?</li>
        <p>JavaScript has three kind of popup boxes: Alert box, Confirm box, and Prompt box. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alert Box- An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.

                When an alert box pops up, the user will have to click "OK" to proceed.</li>

             <li>Confirm Box- A confirm box is often used if you want the user to verify or accept something.

                When a confirm box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed.
                    
             If the user clicks "OK", the box returns true. If the user clicks "Cancel", the box returns false.
                    
              </li>

              <li>Prompt Box- A prompt box is often used if you want the user to input a value before entering a page.

                When a prompt box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed after entering an input value.
                
                If the user clicks "OK" the box returns the input value. If the user clicks "Cancel" the box returns null.
                
                </li>
        </ul>
      
            <li> What is the use of Void (0)? </li>
            <p>JavaScript void 0 means returning undefined (void) as a primitive value. You might come across the term “JavaScript:void(0)” while going through HTML documents. It is used to prevent any side effects caused while inserting an expression in a web page.</p>

            <li>How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?</li>
            <p>We can use window.location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another page in Javascript. It is a reference to a Location object that is it represents the current location of the document. We can change the URL of a window by accessing it.</p>

            <li>What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?</li>
            <p>
                <h4>Disadvantages of using innerHTML property in JavaScript:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The use of innerHTML very slow: The process of using innerHTML is much slower as its contents as slowly built, also already parsed contents and elements are also re-parsed which takes time.</li>

                    <li>Preserves event handlers attached to any DOM elements: The event handlers do not get attached to the new elements created by setting innerHTML automatically. To do so one has to keep track of the event handlers and attach it to new elements manually. This may cause a memory leak on some browsers.</li>

                    <li>Content is replaced everywhere: Either you add, append, delete or modify contents on a webpage using innerHTML, all contents is replaced, also all the DOM nodes inside that element are reparsed and recreated.</li>

                    <li>Appending to innerHTML is not supported: Usually, += is used for appending in JavaScript. But on appending to an Html tag using innerHTML, the whole tag is re-parsed.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
    </ol>
